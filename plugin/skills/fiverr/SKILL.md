# Fiverr Gig Skill

## Platform Overview

Fiverr is a fixed-price gig marketplace. Buyers browse categories, filter by price and seller level, and contact sellers directly. Discovery is primarily algorithmic — gig title and tags drive impressions; the description and pricing tiers drive conversion.

**{{USER_FIRST_NAME}}'s use case:** offering B2B content, documentation, and PMM consulting services to technical companies. Her buyers are typically startup founders, PMMs, or heads of marketing who need expert-level output, not cheap production.

## Gig Anatomy (5 Tabs)

Every gig has five surfaces that must work together:

### Tab 1: Overview (Title + Tags + Category)

**Title rules:**
- Max 80 characters
- Lead with the service, not the outcome: "I will write technical documentation for your API" not "I will make your docs amazing"
- Include the primary keyword buyers search (e.g., "technical writing", "product marketing", "API documentation")
- No ALL CAPS, no exclamation marks, no emoji

**Category selection:**
- Choose the most specific subcategory available — broad categories bury listings
- Primary category + up to 2 subcategories

**Tags:** 5 tags maximum. Use the exact phrases buyers type, not internal jargon. Check autocomplete on Fiverr for popular variants.

**Gig URL:** set this to match the primary keyword before the gig goes live — it cannot be changed after the first sale.

### Tab 2: Pricing (Basic / Standard / Premium)

**Three-tier structure:**

| Tier | Purpose | Price floor |
|---|---|---|
| Basic | One bounded deliverable; no revisions | `pricing_floors.fiverr_basic` |
| Standard | Full project scope; 1 revision | `pricing_floors.fiverr_standard` |
| Premium | Priority + extended scope + 2 revisions | `pricing_floors.fiverr_premium` |

Read floors from `${CAREER_DATA}/references/pipeline-preferences.json` → `freelance.pricing_floors`.

**Pricing rules:**
- Never price below the floors in `${CAREER_DATA}/references/pipeline-preferences.json` → `freelance.pricing_floors` — they exist for a reason
- Premium should be 2–2.5x Standard, not 1.1x
- Each tier must have a clearly distinct scope — if the difference is vague, buyers pick Basic and then ask for more
- Delivery time: be conservative; Fiverr penalises late deliveries

**Extras:** up to 5 add-ons (e.g., "Extra revision +$X", "Source files +$X", "Express delivery +$X"). Only add extras that are genuinely separable from the base scope.

### Tab 3: Description

**Structure:**
1. **Opening line** — one sentence: who this gig is for and what they get. Not a biography.
2. **What I deliver** — bulleted list of specific deliverables. Concrete, not aspirational.
3. **What makes this different** — 2–3 sentences on the specific expertise or approach. Named context where possible (sectors, tools, scale).
4. **Who this is NOT for** — one sentence. Scopes out mismatched buyers and signals confidence.
5. **Process / what to expect** — brief: how you work together, what you need from them, timeline.
6. **Call to action** — one line.

**Length:** 400–700 words. Under 400 looks thin; over 700 loses buyers.

**Formatting:** short paragraphs, bullet lists for deliverables. No walls of text. Headers optional but useful for longer descriptions.

**Voice rules (in addition to shared-voice-rules.md):**
- Write to the buyer, not about yourself: "You'll receive..." not "I am a passionate..."
- Specificity signals expertise: name tools, formats, sectors where relevant
- No testimonial-style self-description ("highly rated", "expert-level", "world-class")
- No urgency manufacturing ("limited slots", "book now before prices rise")

### Tab 4: FAQ

**5–7 questions maximum.** Answer the questions buyers actually ask, not the ones that make you look good.

Common useful FAQs for technical/PMM services:
- "What information do I need to provide?" → sets expectations, reduces back-and-forth
- "Do you have experience with [sector]?" → answer specifically
- "What formats do you deliver in?" → be precise
- "How many revisions are included?" → state clearly
- "Can you work with my existing style guide?" → yes/no + process

One FAQ per real question. No FAQ that's really a sales pitch.

### Tab 5: Gallery (Images + Video)

**First image = thumbnail = most important.** Buyers see 3–4 thumbnails in search results. The thumbnail must communicate the gig in 0.5 seconds.

Thumbnail best practices:
- Clear, readable text at small sizes
- One primary service name, one specific niche or outcome
- No stock photo faces; professional but not corporate-stock
- Consistent with brand colours if you have them

**Portfolio samples:** include 2–3 real work samples (anonymised if needed). Buyers in the B2B/technical space specifically look for proof of quality.

**Video (optional but impactful):** 60–90 second intro. Higher conversion rate, but only worth doing if the production quality is solid.
