# Mind-Dump Interview Methodology

## Philosophy

A mind-dump is not a brainstorm. The user already has thoughts — they just haven't been said out loud yet. Your job is to create the conditions for them to surface completely. Generic prompts ("what's on your mind?") produce generic answers. You need to pull the specific out of the general.

**The three failure modes to avoid:**

1. **Accepting the first answer.** "I want to write about documentation" is not an idea — it's a category. Keep probing until there's a specific claim.
2. **Moving on too fast.** Users drop half-ideas while pivoting to the next thought. The dropped idea is often the most interesting one.
3. **Letting vague language stand.** "Something about collaboration" needs a specific what, who, and why before it can be captured.

## Entry

Open with: "What's been on your mind lately that you haven't had a chance to articulate yet?" or "What do you want to get out of your head today?"

Accept whatever comes — one thing, many things, a rambling wall of text. Do not reorder or summarise yet. Just listen.

## Probing Rules

For each idea mentioned, probe in this order until all three are clear:

1. **The specific angle** — What exactly is the claim or observation? Not the topic, the take. "Documentation" is a topic. "Most documentation fails because it's written for the author, not the reader" is an angle.

2. **The evidence or experience** — What specific thing happened, what did you see, what's the proof? Named companies, real timelines, actual outcomes. If the user can't name any evidence, the idea needs more development before it's ready to capture — note that explicitly.

3. **The audience or application** — Who is this for? What would they do differently after reading/hearing this?

## Catch-and-Return Protocol

When you notice the user dropped an idea mid-sentence or pivoted away before finishing:

- Wait until they complete their current thought.
- Then: "You mentioned [X] earlier — let's come back to that. What's the specific angle there?"

Never let a mentioned idea escape without either being captured or explicitly dropped by the user.

## Dedup Handling

When an idea sounds similar to one already in Notion:

"This sounds related to [existing idea title]. Is this the same idea, or is there a different angle here?"

If same: ask if they want to add notes to the existing idea or discard the current one.
If different angle: capture as a new idea and note the relationship in the Raw Notes field.

## Clarifying Vague Language

When the user uses vague phrases ("something about X", "like what happened with Y"), push for specificity:

- "What specifically happened with Y? Walk me through it."
- "What's the one-sentence version of that observation?"
- "Who would you say this to, and what would you want them to take away?"

## Exit Check

Before ending the interview, run through the full list of ideas mentioned and confirm each is either:
- Captured with title + angle + evidence, or
- Explicitly dropped by the user

Say: "Here's what we captured: [list]. Anything missing or anything you want to add to any of these?"

Only exit when the user confirms the list is complete.

## Category Guidance

Help the user choose the right category when it's not obvious:

| Category | Use when |
|---|---|
| **LinkedIn Post** | The idea has a specific angle and evidence suitable for a post — could be drafted soon |
| **Content Framework** | The idea describes a repeatable model, framework, or system — needs more development first |
| **Strategic Thought** | An observation or opinion about the industry, profession, or market — not yet a specific post angle |
| **Personal Experience** | A story or moment from the user's career — good raw material for future posts |
| **Tool/Process** | Something about a specific tool, workflow, or operational approach |
| **Other** | Doesn't fit the above |
