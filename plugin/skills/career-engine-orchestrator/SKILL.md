name: career-engine-orchestrator
description: Run the user's career-engine pipeline against the Notion Job Applications database. Trigger whenever the user says "run the career engine", "process the CV queue", "run the CV pipeline", or any variant referencing a batch of tailored CVs or cover letters. Fetches all queued roles from Notion, passes them to the career coach (which fetches JDs and produces strategic properties), builds the processing queue, and routes each role to the pipeline the user specifies in chat.

> **Codex host:** Before using this document, read `${CAREER_ENGINE_ROOT}/CODEX-RUNTIME.md`. Resolve the root from this skill’s installed path. That contract replaces Claude-specific APIs, installation, personal-data discovery, and role spawning; all career doctrine, gates, and required reads below still apply.
