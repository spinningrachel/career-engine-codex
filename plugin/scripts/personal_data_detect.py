"""Shared personal-data detection for the plugin repo. One implementation, three callers.

Callers: scripts/scan-personal-data.sh (repo + staged), scripts/block-personal-data-writes.sh
(the PreToolUse block hook), scripts/build-plugin.sh (pre-build and artifact scans).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The first version of this guard implemented the same detection three
times, and all three shared one flawed rule: an allowlist matched against the WHOLE LINE.
Any line containing an allowed token — `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, `example.com`, even the literal
string `build-plugin.sh` — was exempt from every detector. So this line passed all three
layers clean:

    "output_folder": "/Users/someone/Docs/out", "cv_template": "{{CV_TEMPLATE}}"

That is not a contrived evasion. It is the single most likely shape for a leak here — a
config example — and it is the shape of the file that actually shipped in eight builds in
June 2026. Three layers, one blind spot, zero coverage.

THE FIX, and the rule to preserve if you edit this file: an allowed token neutralises only
the SPAN IT COVERS, never the line. Allowed spans are cut out of the line first; detectors
then run on whatever remains. A real value sitting next to a placeholder is still a real
value, and is still caught.

File-level exemptions are matched against the PATH only, never the content — otherwise any
file that merely mentions a guard script's name exempts itself.
