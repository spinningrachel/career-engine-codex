# block-personal-data-writes.sh — PreToolUse hook. Refuses any tool call that would put
# personal data inside the plugin repo.
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT A RULE. Every other guard is downstream of the write: .gitignore
# catches it at commit, the packaging filter at build, the QA scan afterwards. Personal
# data still reached the public repo, and a personal config dump still reached eight
# shipped .plugin artifacts, because an agent that has decided to write the file has
# already defeated all three. This is the only layer that refuses the write itself.
#
# Covers Write / Edit / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit, the MCP filesystem write tools, and
# Bash commands that redirect or copy into the repo. Detection is shared with the other
# layers via scripts/personal_data_detect.py.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse payload on stdin. Exit 2 = block (stderr returns to the model).
# Any internal error exits 0 — this hook must never wedge a session; the pre-commit and
# build scans remain as backstops.
